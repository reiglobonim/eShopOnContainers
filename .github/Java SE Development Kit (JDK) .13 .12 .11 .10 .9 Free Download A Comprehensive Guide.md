## Step 2: Install the JDK
 
The next step is to install the JDK on your computer. The installation process may vary slightly depending on your operating system and platform, but it is generally straightforward and easy to follow.
 
Here are the general steps to install the JDK:

1. Double-click on the downloaded file to launch the installer.
2. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation.
3. Choose a destination folder for the JDK installation.
4. Optionally, you can also choose to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) along with the JDK.
5. Optionally, you can also choose to install the Java Development Kit Documentation along with the JDK.
6. Click on Finish to complete the installation.

The installer will also create an environment variable called JAVA\_HOME that points to the location of the JDK installation folder.
 
## Step 3: Verify the JDK Installation
 
The final step is to verify that the JDK installation was successful and that you can use it to compile and run Java programs.
 
To verify the JDK installation, open a command prompt or terminal window and type:
  ```java java -version ```  
You should see a message that displays the version of Java that you have installed, such as:
  ```java java version "13.0.2" 2020-01-14 Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 13.0.2+8) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 13.0.2+8, mixed mode, sharing) ```  
If you see a message like this, it means that the JDK installation was successful and you can start developing Java applications and applets.
